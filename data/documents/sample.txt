Company Return Policy

Our company offers a 30-day return policy for all unused products in their original packaging. 
Items that have been opened or used may be eligible for a partial refund or store credit, 
depending on the condition of the item upon return.

To initiate a return, customers must:
1. Contact customer service at returns@example.com
2. Provide the order number and reason for return
3. Receive a return authorization number
4. Ship the item back within 7 days of receiving the return authorization

Shipping costs for returns are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due 
to a defect or error on our part. Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days after 
the returned item is received and inspected.

Special conditions:
- Seasonal items have a 14-day return window
- Electronics must be returned within 15 days
- Custom or personalized items cannot be returned
- Sale items marked "Final Sale" cannot be returned

For exchanges, customers should follow the same process as returns. If the exchanged item 
has a different price, the difference will be charged or refunded accordingly.
